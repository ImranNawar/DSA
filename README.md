# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains C++ implementations of various data structures and algorithms, including:

- Strings
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Recursion
- Heap

The implementations are intended to serve as a reference and study material for those learning about data structures and algorithms.

## Strings

Strings are a sequence of characters in a programming language. 

## Arrays

An array is a data structure that holds a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

## Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure that stores elements in nodes, and each node has a reference to the next node in the list. 

## Stacks

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Queues

A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

## Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem.

## Heap

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is used to implement priority queues.

## Conclusion

This repository provides an easy-to-understand implementation of various data structures and algorithms that can be used as a reference or a learning material. If you have any suggestions or contributions, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.
